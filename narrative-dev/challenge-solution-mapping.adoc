= Challenge / Practice Mapping

* code generation

* too many steps to get a change published
 ** practices: continuous deployment
 ** story: James' "branch builds"
 ** everything between making a change and publishing should be automated
 ** changes should be detected automatically
 ** gateway criteria for controlled releases
 ** a CD process is self-documenting
 ** implies having a build, but a lot more; configuration as code
 ** prevents drift between environments
 ** publishing should never be manual
 ** once production is CD, next logical step is staging (or vice-versa)

* I can't preview the site locally or on a staging server
 ** practices: build + CI/CD; containerization
 ** story: Chris @ MuleSoft
 ** story: DITA @ Couchbase
 ** everything needed to build the documentation is stored with the documentation; no "works on my machine"
 ** no information walks out the door or lives on someone's harddrive; no need for specialized knowledge
 ** reproducible
 ** no drift between workspace and production
 ** easier to onboard, which means contributions more likely, less expensive
 ** advocates a way of working with the content; everyone is previewing the same way; all get same picture
 ** avoids long turn around times
 ** build doesn't just build, it pulls too; sets up the author's environment

* there are broken links and other broken references
 ** practices: static analysis / linter + continuous integration
 ** story: humans were put on this earth to break links
 ** implies that we have a continuous integration process
 ** implies you have a build
 ** what about references between versions if there are newer versions available

* spending all our time making updates
 ** practices: DRY
 ** story: we hear from a lot of documentation teams that they are buried in work; no time for new initiatives
 ** variables for version numbers and product names
 ** includes for shared content (i.e., partials)
 ** auto-generate derived content such as release notes, API docs, reference tables, code sample output
 ** notifications about content needs to be reviewed be of triggers
 ** templates to create new documents, sections, folder structure

* have to "go offline" to edit / make a major revision; we can't accept contributions
 ** practices: contribution workflow
 ** need an integrated contribution workflow; pull requests instead of e-mail
 ** need to be able to discuss the changes; integrated discussion thread
 ** code review process
 ** there should be a way to track work / initiatives => issue tracker
 ** decide when changes are due; so implies milestones / roadmap
 ** apply the change multiple times; "patch"
 ** could enforce that all changes have to go through this process
 ** teach them git (https://twitter.com/mairin/status/922799825116106752)

* versions are hard; we haven't figure out how to do versions
 ** practices: version control
 ** story: Balsamiq version "solution" (https://www.docslikecode.com/articles/balsamiq-case-study-part-1/)
 ** version control system is for managing file revisions
 ** branches were designed for managing different version lines; don't reinvent branches using version folders or file suffix
 ** content that is versioned together goes together; how to split repositories
 ** by having versions in branches, you don't have to build all versions
 ** can protect branches

* content repository is too large; people are stepping on each others toes; build everything at once
 ** practice: modularization + maintainers + project metadata
 ** would you put all your software in one repository
 ** the idea that there's just one repository of content is not truthful
 ** content should be split along lines of responsibility; encourages content owners
 ** can apply different permissions to different areas of content
 ** smaller chunks are easier to maintain, reuse, and remix
 ** relationships are easier to understand; can be pulled apart; can reason about circular references
 ** separate the existence of something with the inclusion of something; means to archive / sunset

* no two documentation projects are the same; I don't know where any of the files are
 ** practices: standard project structure
 ** a standard project structure is recognizable; no snowflakes
 ** creates a culture of standardization and consistency
 ** easy to start up the next initiative; you can have project generators
 ** bring a lot of other stuff for free
 ** tools can be designed to work with the project
 ** eliminates much of the configuration effort
 ** eases content migration

* the samples in the documentation are broken
 ** practice: DRY + testing
 ** code samples should be tested
 ** code samples should be included from shared project (not e-mailed)
 ** code samples should be separately downloadable (or clonable)
 ** output from code sample should be inserted automatically
 ** need a way to tag code to be included
 ** code samples should be interactive
 ** user failure triggers a workflow to review / update the document, and in particular, the example (treated as bug)

* other teams are bulldozing our project; breaking things; making changes without approval
 ** practice: development process + governance
 ** if there are strong rules in place, backed up by automation, people will be unable to break them
 ** this happening is often a sign of a process that is breaking down; so just having a process solves this issue in part; people undermine because the process is breaking down or there is no process
 ** gives the project stability
 ** understood guidelines
 ** works even if personnel changes; supercedes personnel
 ** no one to blame if the process is not enforcing
 ** don't give docs a pass just because they are docs
