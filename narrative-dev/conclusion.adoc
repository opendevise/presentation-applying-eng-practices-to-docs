Nearly everyone agrees we have a documentation problem.
The situation is dire.
We need to act.
But the solution is not to try to turn engineers into writers.
It's for engineers to solve engineering problems to free up writers to write.
A tech writer is just as valuable to a software project as an engineer, so long as they are actually writing.
(Just as the reverse would be true).
We just need to make them productive.
In the end, they will get the job done more efficiently and give the software an incredible curb appeal.
And you won't be pestered about writing any more.

So we reached into our back of tricks to find ways to improve the documentation process.
There are many engineering practices we could draw from.
In this talk, I focused on a few that I've found have the most impact with documentation.
I look forward to hearing which other practices you apply.

Thank you.
