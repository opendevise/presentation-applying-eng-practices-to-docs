* Establish the importance of documentation in software and the dire need to improve it

* Change the dialog by making it clear I'm not asking engineers to write; let writers do the writing
 ** we're not going to be talking about writing, except for when it intersects with an engineering practice
 ** deal with the reason why the writers are not writing; or not writing something that works

* Focus on the fact that documentation is just as much of an engineering discipline as software development is (familiar territory), which means engineers are required

* Engineers have a lot of experience & expertise to offer a documentation team; in return the docs team will write your docs for you; symbiotic; lowers the bar to helping w/ docs

* What are the engineering practices?
 ** (get them thinking about how all this applies to documentation)
 ** practices are also policies (or lead to policies)

* What are writers' common complaints?

* What practices can we apply to address those complaints and how?
 ** e.g., a broken link is a compile error
 ** versions are hard
 ** *let's focus on creating this list*

* How do you know when you're successful?
 ** can writers press a button to publish the docs to production? rollback?
 ** can writers continuously preview their work in progress in a staging area? do they have to set it up each time?
 ** can a new writer figure out how to build the documentation quickly?
 ** is everything need to build the documentation in the repository?
 ** is it easy to contribute a change to the documentation? (could you imagine having to e-mail someone when you want to change the code?)
 ** are the examples in the documentation in sync with the software and tested?
 ** are the docs set up so that another team can help the docs team, such as UI developer
 ** is it easy to figure out who wrote a doc so you know who to talk to when it needs to be updated? "maintainers"
 ** is it impossible to break the documentation because the process would literally prevent it from happening?
  *** if it does go wrong for some reason, are writers notified?

* Restate roles
 ** this is not about turning tech writers into engineers; it's getting tech writers to adopt engineering practices so that they can benefit from the same rigorous process and tools that engineers enjoy; engineers are the ones who have those practices to share

* Conclusion
 ** I feel strongly that the documentation problem is an engineering problem; writers aren't just being asked to write; they are being asked to solve all these engineering problems that they often aren't equiped to handle; if they could just write, and the documentation project was set up and maintained with engineering practices with the help of engineers, then I think they could just write; and, as a result, we'd see better documentation; software lifecycle would come full circle (close the loop)
if you are a software developer who is maintaining documentation, why are you not applying the same practices you use for your programming
