// challenge: starting something new means starting from scratch; lots of steps to get going
// solution: code generation / templates / tooling
Another way to accelerate writers is to give them templates to create new documents, sections, or a whole folder structure.
Just think about how you develop.
Chances are, you use some sort of wizard to get started on a task, whether it's to create a new project or just a Java class.
Why do we expect writers to start from a blank page?
If we can give them tools to create new things, even if it's a small thing, it will likely have a big impact on motivation and givem them momentum.
It also helps to encourage consistency.

// challenge: knowing what to update
// solution: notifications of changes that affect the documentation
Finally, and a big one, with documentation teams so busy all the time, how do they even know what to update?
As developers, we're pretty much driven by notifications.
We get a notification that something happened, something new is available, and we give that thing attention.
Writers can't possibly scan all the hundreds or thousands of documents they have to maintain.
They need some pointers.

One client of ours had asked if there was a button that could be pressed by developers to let them know when there was a new release.
The client has the right idea, maybe just not the right means.

They should be able to receive notifications about the sofware that the content documents so they have a burndown list of what to evaluate.
If any part of that notification can trigger an automatic update, such as updating a version number, then that should definitely be done to save them the trouble.
One tool that comes to mind is greenkeeper or dependencies.io.
These tools send automatic pull requests to update the dependencies of a project when new versions become available.

This is definitely something that could be developed for documentation as well.
Just think of all the time it would save.
